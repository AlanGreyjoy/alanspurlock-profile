You must use the Spurlock UI library to build the UI.

The Spurlock UI library is located in the libs/spurlock-ui directory.

This is our component library. You must use the components in this library to build the UI, if it is not in this library, you must create it.

You must use the Tailwind CSS framework to build the UI.

You must use the Radix UI library to build the UI.

If Radix does not have a component that you need, use a popular alternative like react-select.

Data tables should use the tanstack table library.
