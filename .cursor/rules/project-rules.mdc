# Project Overview

This project is my personal website. It is basically my resume and portfolio and whatever random stuff I want to throw on it.

It is heavily vibe coded. Why? Because I know what I am doing.

# Architecture Principles

## Monorepo

- This is a monorepo project.
- We use Nx to manage the project.
- We use pnpm to manage the dependencies.

## Domain Driven Design (DDD)

- Organize code by business domains, not technical layers
- Use bounded contexts to separate domain models
- Keep domain logic pure and independent of infrastructure

## SOLID Principles

- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function should have one reason to change
- **Open/Closed**: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types
- **Interface Segregation**: Many specific interfaces are better than one general interface
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Separation of Concerns (SOC)

- Separate presentation logic from business logic
- Keep UI components focused on rendering and user interaction
- Isolate data fetching and state management from components
- Maintain clear boundaries between layers (UI, domain, infrastructure)

## Code Quality

### Cyclomatic Complexity

- Keep cyclomatic complexity below 10 per function/method
- Refactor complex functions into smaller, focused units
- Use early returns and guard clauses to reduce nesting

### Code Splitting

- Implement lazy loading for routes and heavy components
- Split vendor bundles from application code
- Use dynamic imports for large dependencies
- Optimize bundle size for initial page load

# Considerations

- DO NOT create .md files unless explicitly requested
- DO NOT run apps or servers. Chances are, we already have a task running them. You just fuck everything up with you do that.
- If you are stuck, search the internet for a solution.
